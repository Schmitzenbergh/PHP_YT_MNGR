# PHP_YT_MNGR
A basic PHP Youtube manger for the course PHP2 on the NHL Stenden university of applied sciences.

*   GET/POST superglobal handling (Forms);
*   File I/O via File(), FOpen(), FWrite() and FClose();
*   Errorhandling;
*   Defining constants;
*   Combining strings with variables;

# How to use
